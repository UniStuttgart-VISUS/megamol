## Protein_Uncertainty-Plugin

### About

The Protein_Uncertainty-Plugin contains modules that are targeted on the visualization of the uncertainty in protein data.
The current modules use secondary structure uncertainty computed by a Python script to generate the renderings.

### Prerequisites
* VISLib
* MegaMol-Core
* protein_calls-Plugin
* protein-Plugin
* mmstd_trisoup-Plugin
* (Python)

### Using the Plugin
The main data sources for the modules of this plugin are the UncertaintyDataLoader and the PDBLoader.
The necessary data for the UncertaintyDataLoader can be generated via the UncertaintyInputData.py-script located in the Resources folder.
To run this script, a working Python installation is required.
It requires a valid pdb-ID to generate the necessary input data for the loader. 
Currently, the needed executables are only tested under Windows.

| Module | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| RamachandranDataCall | Call to transfer the dihedral angles of a protein. |
| RamachandranPlot | Renderer that computes and renders a ramachandran plot for a given protein and outputs the computed dihedral angles into a RamachandranDataCall. |
| UncertaintyCartoonRenderer | Renderer that renders a protein cartoon representation with an added uncertainty value. |
| UncertaintyDataCall | Call that transfers the protein uncertainty data. |
| UncertaintyDataLoader | The main data loader for this plugin. It loads the data generated by the UncertaintyInputData.py script. |
| UncertaintySequenceRenderer | Renderer that renders a uncertain sequence diagram for a given protein. |
