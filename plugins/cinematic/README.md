# MegaMol Plugin: "Cinematic"

This plugin allows the video rendering (separate file per frame) of any rendering output in MegaMol.
By defining fixed keyframes for desired camera positions and specific animation times, arbitrary tracking shots can be created.

## Module Descriptions
This plugin provides the modules `KeyframeKeeper`,  `TrackingShotRenderer`, `CinematicView`, `TimeLineRenderer` and `ReplacementRenderer`.

#### KeyframeKeeper:

This module maintains the keyframes and their properties centralised. 
The modules `TrackingShotRenderer`, `CinematicView` and `TimeLineRenderer` have to be connected with the same `KeyframeKeeper` (see module call graph below).

#### TrackingShotRenderer:

This module shows the spatial position of the defined keyframes and the resulting tracking shot. 
It allows the direct selection of keyframes by left mouse button. 
The position and direction of the camera parameters of a keyframe can be altered by drag & drop with left mouse button on shown manipulators.
There are two modes for showing differnt manipulators for a selected keyframe.

#### CinematicView:

This module provides the preview of the final view to be rendered.
Here a desired camera view can be chosen.
The desired view can be applied to an existing selected keyframe or a new keyframe.
By running the animation as preview one can audit the final view of the video.
The complete final video is defined by the resolution and the number of frames per second and can be rendered to png files.

#### TimeLineRenderer:

This module shows the temporal position of the keyframes on the animation time axis and the simulation time axis in an two-dimensional diagram.
The keyframes can be selected (left mouse button) or they can be shifted along the simulation or animation time axis per drag and drop (right mouse button).
The time axes can be zoomed (middle mouse button) and shifted (right mouse button) independently at the current mouse position.

#### ReplacementRenderer:

This module offers replacement rendering for models with performance too low for interactivly creating the tracking shot. 
Therefore only a coloured bounding box of the model is drawn.

## How to use the modules

The modules should be connected as shown in the module call graph below. 
The yellow-tagged renderer module and the data source module can be replaced by any other suitable modules. 
Note: The renderer module has to be connected to the `TrackingShotRenderer` as well as to the `CinematicView`.
For simplification the preferred way of adding the cinematic graph to a new project is to use the predefined cinematic module call graph via the `examples/cinematic/cinematic_editor.lua` project (see example below).

![megamol example module call graph](graph.png)

### Example

In order to run the example change to the `bin` folder of the megamol executables in a shell and start the program with the following command:
*Under Windows:* `.\mmconsole.exe -p ../examples/cinematic/cinematic_editor.lua`   
*Under Linux:* `./megamol.sh -p ../examples/cinematic/cinematic_editor.lua`

#### How it works
In the `cinematic_editor.lua` project file the testsphere project `examples/testsphere.lua` is automatically appended to the cinematic module graph (see yellow modules in graph above). 
Additionally the corresponding keyframe file for the testsphere project `examples/cinematic/cinematic_keyframes.kf` is loaded. 
Any other `lua` project file can be included by changing the appropriate line in `cinematic_editor.lua`. 
The keyframe file can be set to the empty string for the initial loading of a new project and can be set to a newly created keyframe file later.
