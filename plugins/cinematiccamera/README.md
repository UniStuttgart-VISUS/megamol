# MegaMolâ„¢ Plugin "Cinematic Camera"

This module allows the video rendering of simulations.
By defining fixed keyframes of desired camera positions for specific animation times arbitrary tracking shots can be created.

## Module Descriptions
This plugin provides the modules `KeyframeKeeper`,  `CinematicRenderer`, `CinematicView`, `TimeLineRenderer` and `ReplacementRenderer`.

#### KeyframeKeeper:

This module maintains the keyframes and their properties centralised. 
The modules `CinematicRenderer`, `CinematicView` and `TimeLineRenderer` have to be connected with the same `KeyframeKeeper` (see module call graph below).

#### CinematicRenderer:

This module shows the spatial position of the defined keyframes and the resulting tracking shot. 
It allows the selection of keyframes by mouse. 
The position and direction of the camera parameters of a keyframe can be altered by selectable manipulators.

#### CinematicView:

This module provides the preview of the final view to be rendered.
Any desired view can be applied to an existing or a new keyframe.
By running the animation as preview one can audit the final view of the video.
The complete final video is defined by the resolution and the number of frames per second and can be rendered to png files.

#### TimeLineRenderer:

This module shows the temporal position of the keyframes on the animation time axis and the simulation time axis in an two-dimensional diagram.
The keyframes can be selected (left mouse button) or they can be shifted along the simulation or animation time axis per drag and drop (right mouse button).
The time axes can be zoomed and shifted independently at the current mouse position (middle mouse button, right mouse button).

#### ReplacementRenderer:

This module offers replacement rendering for models with performance too low for interactivly creating the tracking shot. 
Therefore only the bounding box of the model is drawn.

## How to use the module

The modules should be connected as shown in the module call graph below. 
The dark yellow tagged renderer module can be replaced by any other suitable one. 
The renderer module has to be connected to the `CinematicRenderer` as well as to the `CinematicView`.
The light yellow tagged data source module has to be replaced by a suitable one for the used renderer module.

### Example

The sample project files (`cinematic_editor.lua`,`cinematic_keyframes.kf` ) which are supported in the `examples` folder of this plugin have to be copied into the `bin` folder of megamol.
In a shell change to the `bin` folder of the megamol executables and start the program with the command:   
*Under Windows:* `.\mmconsole.exe -p cinematic_editor.lua`   
*Under Linux:* `./megamol.sh -p cinematic_editor.lua`
