 * Bitmap codec for the portable pixmap file format (ppm).
 *
 * This is a very simple file format which is implemented mainly for
 * development purpose. This codec implements all functions, however, it is
 * not recommended to use this file format in production systems.
 *
 * Includes experimental support for float PPMs (magic: PF/Pf). It is unclear
 * how much of the float format can be seen as standardized, however
 * floatmaps are assumed to only come in binary flavors (asBinary is ignored).
 * Exceptions are thrown when trying to load/save floatmaps on systems
 * with exotic byte order (e.g. middle endian).
 *
 * This code might be used as reference when implementing additional
 * bitmap codec classes.
