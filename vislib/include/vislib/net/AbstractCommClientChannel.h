/**
 * The AbstractCommClientChannel represents a bidiectional, full duplex
 * communication channel. Subclasses must implement this behaviour by
 * providing an implementation for all pure virtual methods defined by this
 * interface.
 *
 * This class is part of the VISlib communication channel abstraction
 * layer. This layer is intended to provide a common class-based interface
 * for different network technologies.
 *
 * Note for implementors: Subclasses should provide static Create()
 * methods which create objects on the heap that must have been created
 * with C++ new. The Release() method of this class assumes creation
 * with C++ new and releases the object be calling delete once the last
 * reference was released.
 *
 * Rationale: Due to the design-inherent polymorphism of this abstraction
 * layer, we use reference counting for managing the objects. This is
 * because some classes in the layer must return objects on the heap. Users
 * of AbstractCommChannel should use SmartRef for handling the reference
 * counting.
 *
 * Note for implementors: Subclasses that provide the server and the client
 * interface in one class should inherit from AbstractCommChannel.
