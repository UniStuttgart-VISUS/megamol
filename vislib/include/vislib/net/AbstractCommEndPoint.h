     * This class defines the interface for a network end point address in the
     * VISlib comm channel infrastructure. VISlib comm channels provide an 
     * abstraction of sockets and IB verbs, which is designed to be 
     * interchangeable.
     * 
     * Note for implementors: The AbstractCommEndPoint is designed to 
     * work with a reference counting mechanism like Direct 3D. It therefore
     * inherits from ReferenceCounted and has a protected ctor and dtor. 
     * Subclasses should provide static Create() methods which do the necessary
     * address parsing and return a pointer to an object on the heap, which
     * must have been created with C++ new. The Release() method of this class
     * assumes creation with C++ new and releases the object be calling
     * delete once the last reference was released.
     *
     * Rationale: AbstractCommEndPoint must support polymorphism for
     * supporting different types of comm channels and address types with the
     * same interface. Therefore, the use of pointers is mandatory. Using
     * reference counting in conjunction with SmartRefs allows for a reasonably
     * safe management of the object life time.
