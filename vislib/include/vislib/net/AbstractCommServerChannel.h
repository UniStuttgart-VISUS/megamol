     * This class defines the interface for server end points in the VISlib
     * communication channel abstraction layer.
     *
     * Note for implementors: Subclasses should provide static Create() 
     * methods which create objects on the heap that must have been created 
     * with C++ new. The Release() method of this class assumes creation 
     * with C++ new and releases the object be calling delete once the last 
     * reference was released.
     *
     * Rationale: Due to the design-inherent polymorphism of this abstraction 
     * layer, we use reference counting for managing the objects. This is 
     * because some classes in the layer must return objects on the heap. Users
     * of AbstractCommChannel should use SmartRef for handling the reference
     * counting.
     *
     * Note for implementors: Subclasses that provide the server and the client
     * interface in one class should inherit from AbstractCommChannel.
