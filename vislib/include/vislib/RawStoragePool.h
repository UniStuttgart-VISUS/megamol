 * This class implements a pool of RawStorage instances for reuse.

 * reallocations, i.e. if possible, a RawStorage that can already fulfill
 * the request is searched. If such a RawStorage exists, the strategy is
 * best fit. If no such RawStorage exists, the strategy is random and the
 * returned object is resized. If no unused RawStorage exists at all, a
 * new one is created and added to the pool.
 *
 * Note that RawStoragePool is not thread-safe at all!
