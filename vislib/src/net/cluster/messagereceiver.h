 * This thread worker function receives messages for an AbstractClusterNode

 * The context passed to the function has the following lifetime (This is
 * very similar to an IRP on Windows that can run in an arbitrary thread
 * context):
 * 1. The caller allocates it using AllocateRecvMsgCtx().
 * 2. The caller passes it to the thread that is running this function. The
 *    thread function then takes ownership of the memory.
 * 3. The thread calls the onMessageReceiverExiting() notification method of
 *    the receiver specified in the context structure just before it is
 *    exiting. The ownership of the context structure is passed to this
 *    method.
 * 4. The onMessageReceiverExiting() releases the context stucture using
 *    FreeRecvMsgCtx() - that is what the default implementation in
 *    AbstractClusterNode::onMessageReceiverExiting() does - or reuses it
 *    for another receiver thread.
 *
 * @param receiveMessagesCtx A pointer to a ReceiveMessagesCtx structure.
 *                           THIS STRUCTURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED USING
 *                           AllocateRecvMsgCtx(). The function takes
 *                           ownership of the memory.
 *
 * @return The socket error code that caused the function to end or -1 in
 *         case of an unexpected error.
